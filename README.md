# Arduino
My various Arduino projects. The code is really bad, since I'm not used to coding in C,
and most of the programs were made last-second before a competition,
or even just copy-pasted code from online until it worked. Since a lot of the code isn't my work, I won't be licensing this, but it probably falls under CC-SA or something.
